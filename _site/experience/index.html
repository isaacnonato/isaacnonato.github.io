<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>As of programming languages, currently I know JavaScript/TypeScript, Java and C/C++ (basic). Additionally, I know HTML and CSS. I have used technologies such as Node.js, Next.js, Express, Prisma and MongoDB in personal projects. <br /> <br />
I also have experience on Linux and Shell scripting, both of which I use in a daily basis, but I’m a very versatile person who is happy to learn about new technologies and new ways to improve my skills. Currently, I’m studying Computer Networking and descentralized apps to further expand my knowledge, not only to increase my skills as a software developer but also to fulfill my infinite desire for knowledge. <br /></p>

<h2 id="working-experience">Working experience</h2>

<p>Currently I have no professional working experience, but if you want to hire me I can assure you I will give my best.</p>
