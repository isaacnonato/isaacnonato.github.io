## Skills

As of programming languages, currently I know JavaScript/TypeScript, Java and C/C++. Recently, I fell in love with Clojure and have been learning it. It introduced me to the world of functional programming and it's been changing my view on programming languages and software architecture, I have also gained an interested in ReasonML so I might start studying it soon. <br> <br>
I also have experience on Linux and Shell scripting, both of which I use in a daily basis, but I'm a very versatile person who is happy to learn about new technologies and new ways to improve my skills. Currently, I'm studying Computer Networking and descentralized apps to further expand my knowledge, not only to increase my skills as a software developer but also to fulfill my infinite desire for knowledge. <br>

## Working experience

Currently I have no professional working experience, but if you want to hire me I can assure you I will give my best.
